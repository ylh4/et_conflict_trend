## Data Limitations and Caveats

Several important limitations should be considered when interpreting these findings. First, ACLED data collection relies on media reports, government sources, and other publicly available information, which may introduce reporting biases. Events in remote or less-accessible areas may be under-reported, and media attention may vary over time and across regions. Additionally, the quality and availability of source information may differ between the pre and post-Abiy periods, potentially affecting comparability.


To address differences in period length, we employed time-based balancing that preserves all post-Abiy data and matches the pre-Abiy window to the same duration. All rates are calculated as events or fatalities per month to normalize for period length. However, this approach does not account for potential seasonal patterns or long-term trends that may have existed independently of the political transition. The interrupted time-series model attempts to control for pre-existing trends, but residual confounding factors may remain.


Most importantly, this analysis is descriptive rather than causal. The observed changes in conflict patterns cannot be definitively attributed to Abiy Ahmed's leadership or policies alone. Multiple factors—including economic conditions, regional dynamics, international relations, and historical legacies—likely contribute to conflict trends. The pre/post comparison provides a quantitative assessment of changes but does not establish causality. Future research combining quantitative analysis with qualitative investigation would be valuable for understanding the mechanisms underlying these trends.


Finally, while ACLED provides comprehensive coverage, data quality and completeness may vary across event types and regions. Some conflict events may be missed entirely, and fatality counts are often estimates with varying degrees of uncertainty. Readers should interpret the findings with these limitations in mind and consider them as part of a broader body of evidence on conflict in Ethiopia.
